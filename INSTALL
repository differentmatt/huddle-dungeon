These are the build/installation instructions for Openglad.

Openglad provides two methods for building from source.  The primary way is via premake (https://premake.github.io/).  The secondary way is with the Code::Blocks project file (.cbp).

=======
PREMAKE
=======

premake4.lua is the build script to use with premake.  After installing premake, open a command-line terminal and navigate to the openglad diretory.

Entering this command in the terminal will generate GNU Makefiles that can be run with the usual `make` to perform the actual build:
premake4 gmake


And this command will generate project files for Visual Studio 2010.
premake4 vs2010


Openglad uses SDL2.  You must download the development files (e.g. from http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).  Premake needs to know where these are, so the premake script had the following options:
cflags
ldflags
includedirs
libdirs

To specify the path for SDL2, one might call premake like so when using a 64-bit compiler:
premake4 vs2010 includedirs="../SDL2-2.0.4/include" libdirs="../SDL2-2.0.4/lib/x64"

If you installed sdl2 and sdl2-config packages on Linux (like from apt or yum), then you can use:
premake4 gmake cflags="`sdl2-config --cflags`" ldflags="`sdl2-config --libs`"


============
CODE::BLOCKS
============

cb_Openglad.cbp is a Code::Blocks (http://www.codeblocks.org/) project file with build configurations for Windows (mingw32) and Linux.  The compiler (include) and linker "Search directories" are hardcoded to relative paths ("../externals/..."), so those need to be changed in the project's Build options so that they point to the appropriate locations for SDL2, SDL2_mixer, and libpng on your system.


=========
WEB BUILD
=========

The web build uses Emscripten to compile to WebAssembly, allowing the game to run in a browser.

1. Install Emscripten SDK (https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html):

   git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
   cd emsdk
   ./emsdk install latest
   ./emsdk activate latest
   source ./emsdk_env.sh

   Note: You'll need to run `source ./emsdk_env.sh` in each new terminal session,
   or add it to your shell profile.

2. Build:

   ./scripts/build_web.sh

   This compiles all source files, bundles game assets, and outputs the compiled game files to dist/:
   - play.html      (HTML shell with canvas that runs the game)
   - play.js        (JavaScript runtime)
   - play.wasm      (WebAssembly binary)
   - play.data      (packaged game assets)

   The web landing page is dist/index.html, which loads play.html.

3. Test locally:

   cd dist
   python3 -m http.server 8080

   Then open http://localhost:8080/index.html in your browser.
